# Definition

**Area** is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint  necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length  of a curve  (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area)
